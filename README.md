# Symcloud docs

Symcloud is a conceptual implementation of a synchronization and collaboration platform.

## Idea

The idea for this project was founded in the context of my thesis 2014/15. My intention was to create a cloud-application like ˋowncloudˋ with a modern framework ˋsymfonyˋ. This environment should help the project that be used and further developed by a community.

I have traced the owncloud project since the first release and like the software a lot. With my work on the open source CMF ˋSuluˋ I have noticed the power of a big community. Because of these two reasons, I have decided to combine them in my master thesis.
